Subtrace has experimental support for developers on macOS.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start backend">
    Let's say your server is running on port 8000:

    ```
    $ yarn run dev
    [my-app] http server started on localhost:8000
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download Subtrace">
    In a second terminal window, download and start Subtrace:

    ```
    $ curl -fsSL https://subtrace.dev/install.sh | sh
    $ subtrace proxy 9000:8000
    ```

    This will start a server on port 9000.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run proxy">
    When you need to send request to your backend server, send it to
    localhost:9000 instead and it will be automatically proxied.

    ```
    $ curl https://localhost:9000/api/my-app/users/foo
    ```
