Subtrace has experimental support for developers on macOS.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start backend">
    Start your backend service the way you normally do. We'll assume it's
    running on port 8000 in this guide.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download Subtrace">
    Open a terminal and download the latest version of Subtrace:

    ```bash
    curl -fSLO "https://subtrace.dev/download/$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)/subtrace" && chmod +x ./subtrace
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run proxy">
    Run the Subtrace proxy on port 9000. All requests sent to port 9000 will be
    forwarded to 8000:


    ```bash
    ./subtrace proxy 9000:8000
    ```

  <Step title="Watch">
    Open the `subt.link` URL in your browser. Then send some API requests to
    port 9000 and watch them appear in the dashboard:
