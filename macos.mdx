Subtrace has experimental support for developers on macOS.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start your app">
    Let's say your server is running on port 8000:

    ```bash
    # start your app on localhost:8000
    yarn run dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Subtrace">
    In a second terminal window, install Subtrace and start the proxy:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://subtrace.dev/install.sh | sh

    # start subtrace on localhost:9000
    subtrace proxy 9000:8000
    ```

    </Expandable>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run proxy">
    Send requests to localhost:9000 instead to proxy them via Subtrace.

    ```bash
    # change your frontend build to use localhost:9000 as the backend server endpoint
    curl https://localhost:9000
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Watch">
    Open the `subt.link` URL in your browser to watch every request happening
    in realtime:
