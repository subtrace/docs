By default, Subtrace redacts all known authorization credentials from every
request. To change this behaviour, set the `authCredentials` field in your
config YAML file. Here's an example:

```yaml
# The default value is "redact". By setting this field's value to "keep", we're
# overriding the behavior so that Subtrace keeps all credentials unmodified.
authCredentials: "keep"

# ...the rest of your config
tags:
  service: foo
```

To use the config file, set the `--config` command line flag when starting
Subtrace:

```bash
./subtrace run --config=/path/to/subtrace.yaml -- node app.js
```

This option affects the following HTTP headers across all requests:

- `Cookie` header on the request
- `Set-Cookie` header on the response
- `Authorization` header on the response
