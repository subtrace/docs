You can configure Subtrace to tag requests to categorize and search faster when
you're dealing with large request volumes. Tags are commonly used for metadata
specific to your business, organization, or infrastructure.

An example use-case for tags is when you have a microservice architecture. It's
useful to tag each request by the service name so that you can later filter for
network activity within a specific service. Here's an example config:

```yaml
tags:
  service_name: payments-api
  deploy_env: prod
```

To use this config file, use the `--config` command line flag:

```bash
./subtrace run --config=/path/to/subtrace.yaml -- node app.js
```

## Default Tags

Subtrace automatically populates requests with the following set of default set
of tags based on the information it can gather about the environment:

- `hostname`

The following default tags may be relevant if you're on Google Cloud:

- `gcp_project`
- `gke_cluster_location`
- `gke_cluster_name`
- `gke_node_name`
