**Step 1**: Go to [https://subtrace.dev/login](https://subtrace.dev/login) and log in with your single sign-on (SSO) identity provider.

**Step 2**: On the **Let's set up your database** page, follow the onboarding instructions to start the database worker service where your backend requests will be stored.

**Step 3**: Go to the **Tokens** page on the dashboard and click **Create tracer token**.

**Step 4**: Install the latest version of Subtrace:

```bash
curl -fsSLO "https://subtrace.dev/download/latest/$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)/subtrace" && chmod +x ./subtrace
```

**Step 5**: Set the `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` environment variable to the token you generated in the previous step, and use `subtrace run` to start your app.

```bash
# this is just an example, use the token you generated in Step 3
export SUBTRACE_TOKEN=subt_CbBZqZousFZ2IBIATEgKCNPvAtZuaRxbtdlzlzmUqNg

# start your app like you normally do, but using Subtrace
./subtrace run -- node ./app.js
```

Congratulations! Your app is now running under Subtrace. Your requests should automatically appear in the [Subtrace dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard/).

While this is sufficient to get started with Subtrace, you should install Subtrace everywhere in your infrastructure to get the most out of it. Pick the one that matches your situation best to learn more:
