description: 'Welcome! Follow the steps below to get started with Subtrace.'

1. Go to [subtrace.dev/dashboard/tokens](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard/tokens) and log in with your single sign-on (SSO) identity provider.

2. Click **Create API token** to generate a Subtrace API token for your namespace.

3. Start a worker node with Docker. This is where your tracing data will live. Don't forget to set the `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` environment variable.

```bash
export SUBTRACE_TOKEN=
docker pull subtrace.dev/worker:latest
docker run -it --rm -e SUBTRACE_TOKEN=$SUBTRACE_TOKEN -v worker:/var/lib/clickhouse subtrace.dev/worker:latest
```

4. Install Subtrace and start your app under Subtrace to automatically trace requests. Once again, don't forget to set the `SUBTRACE_TOKEN` environment variable.

```bash
export SUBTRACE_TOKEN=
curl -fsSL https://subtrace.dev/install.sh | sh
subtrace run -log=true -- node ./server.js
```

Congratulations! Your app is now running under Subtrace. Send a HTTP request to
your app and you'll see it automatically appear in the Subtrace dashboard.

While this is sufficient to get started with Subtrace, you may want to
integrate Subtrace more deeply within your infra to get the most out of it.
Pick the example that matches your situation best to learn more.
