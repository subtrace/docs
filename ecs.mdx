If you deploy your application on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), Subtrace
is the easiest way to monitor the network activity in your cluster in realtime.

<Note>
Subtrace requires a Linux kernel of 5.14 or newer, so you’ll have to use the
[EC2 launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters_ec2.html)
for your ECS tasks. The
[Fargate launch type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html)
is still on kernel 5.10 as of May 2025 and is not compatible with Subtrace.

<Accordion title="How do I create an ECS cluster with EC2 launch type?">
1. Open **ECS** → **Clusters** → **Create cluster**
   ![Click create cluster](/images/ecs/0-cluster-create-click.png)

2. Give the cluster a name. Anything alphanumeric + hyphens works.
   ![Enter cluster name](/images/ecs/1-cluster-name.png)

3. In the **Infrastructure** panel, uncheck **Fargate** and check **Amazon EC2 instances**.
   ![Select EC2 + ASG](/images/ecs/2-cluster-asg.png)

4. Leave **Create new ASG** selected. ECS will automatically spin up an auto-scaling group so your tasks run on instances that register themselves with the cluster.

5. Choose **Amazon Linux 2023** as the AMI. It ships with Linux kernel version 6.1, which comfortably satisfies Subtrace's 5.14+ requirement.

6. Pick any instance type and a minimum/maximum instance limit for the auto-scaling group. You can change this later.

7. Scroll to the bottom and click **Create**. ECS will provision the ASG, launch EC2 instances, install the ECs agent, auto‑register them with the new cluster and give you a cluster that's compatible with EC2 launch type tasks.

### Updating your task definition to support Subtrace

1. Open **ECS** → **Task definitions**, go to your task and click **Create new revision with JSON**.
   ![open JSON](/images/ecs/5-task-update-button.png)

2. In the JSON editor, add the `SYS_PTRACE` Linux capability to your container `linuxParameters` field:

     ```json
     "linuxParameters": {
       "capabilities": {
         "add": ["SYS_PTRACE"]
       }
     },
     ```

   The `SYS_PTRACE` capability is required because it's what allows Subtrace
   to automatically monitor network activity without any code changes or root
   privileges. The ECS UI does not expose this field, hence the JSON-based
   update to the task definition.

   Set the API token that you created in the [Subtrace dashboard](https://subtrace.dev/dashboard)
   as an environment variable:

     ```json
     "environment": [
       {
         "name": "SUBTRACE_TOKEN",
         "value": "subt_****************"
       }
     ]
     ```
 
   As an example, here's what the task JSON should look like:

3. Click **Create** to create a new task revision.

### Updating the ECS service to deploy the new revision

4. Back in **Clusters** → **Services** → `my-app-service`, click on **Update service**.
   ![update service button](/images/ecs/7-service-update-click.png)

5. In the dropdown, select the revision you just created (or leave blank for “latest”).
   ![choose new revision](/images/ecs/8-service-revision.png)

6. Click **Update** at the bottom. ECS will spin up a new task with the new definition; when it’s healthy, the old one will be stopped.

7. Go to the Subtrace UI and see a realtime stream of all network activity in your service.
